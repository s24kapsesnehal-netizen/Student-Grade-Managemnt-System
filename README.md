# Student-Grade-Managemnt-System
The Student Grade Management System is a simple console-based application developed in Java to automate the basic management of student academic records. The system allows users to add student details, including name and grades in three subjects—Mathematics, English, and Science—and display all stored records along with the calculated average grade for each student. Implemented using core Java features such as arrays, loops, and the Scanner class for input handling, the application provides a menu-driven interface for ease of use. It supports storage for up to 100 students in memory and features formatted tabular output for better readability.
